# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
This case study comprises building a logistic regression model to help an education company X, to improve its lead conversion rate by assigning lead scores. The model has to identify potential leads with the highest chances of conversion and achieve a lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

# Problem Statement 
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

X Education company requires to build a model wherein a lead score has to be assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
